# Heart Disease Prediction Flask App

This is a Flask web application that predicts the risk of heart disease based on user input. The model is trained on a publicly available heart disease dataset and provides an interactive web interface for easy risk assessment.

---

## Project Overview

- **Framework:** Flask (Python)
- **Model:** Machine learning model trained on heart disease data
- **Functionality:**  
  - Collects user health data via a form  
  - Predicts heart disease risk  
  - Displays results with recommendations

---

## Dataset

- **Name:** Heart Disease Dataset (`heart.csv`)
- **Source:** [Kaggle - Heart Disease Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arezaei81/heartcsv)  
- **Description:** Contains health metrics and diagnosis information for heart disease prediction.

## Adding the Dataset

This repository **does not include the dataset** due to file size.  
To use the app, download `heart.csv` from Kaggle and place it in the project's `data/` folder (create it if needed).
